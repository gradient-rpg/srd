# Gradient

Gradient is an open-source, rules-lite, role-playing game system based on [Cairn by Yochai Gal](https://cairnrpg.com/)
  
Character, Adversary, and Ambient generation are quick and random; adventures reward careful exploration, and combat is sometimes frantic and deadly. The intent is to provide a narrative-forward experience, friendly to any fantasy setting and player expertise level.

Welcome to the world of **Talam**.

> Talam turns, as it has always turned, indifferent to the names its children give to the ages.
> 
> In one millenial breath, ice grips continents that once bloomed green. In another, cities of light rise where forests stood, and fall again to dust before the planet completes its thought. The same mountains watch over villages of thatch and stone, then towers of steel and magic, then silence, then something new again.
> 
> The people of each era believe themselves to be the inheritors of the world, the culmination of its purpose. They do not know that others—separated by veils of centuries—walk the same paths, tend the same earth, look up at the same indifferent stars. A farmer plants seeds in soil that once bore the foundations of a floating kingdom. A child plays in ruins that will one day be a marketplace, bustling and bright.
> 
> Time is not a river on Talam. It is an ocean, and all its depths exist at once.
> 
> Some souls, though they cannot know it yet, are destined to glimpse more than one shore. To see what was, what is, and what terrible or beautiful things might still come to pass. They will learn that the planet does not merely endure through time—it remembers, it suffers, it hopes.
> 
> And in the end, they may discover that Talam guards mysteries worth more than kingdoms—truths that exist only for those who dare to seek them.
> 
> Maybe.
> 
> Because Talam turns, as it has always turned, indifferent to the names its children give to the ages.

## System Reference Document

This repository contains the **System Reference Document** for the core rules of the Gradient RPG System. If used by itself, it serves as an adventure game about traversing underground tunnels, decrepit castles, dark forests, and other dreadful places. Character creation can be entirely random and fast, exploration can be tense and rewarding, and combat can be chaotic and lethal. It assumes a generic fantasy world, embracing full randomness, much like the original Cairn. These rules and procedures can then be inherited by any expansion setting, such as Gradient: Roots, and others to come.
