# Gradient

Gradient is an open-license, rules-lite, role-playing game system based on [Cairn by Yochai Gal](https://cairnrpg.com/)
  
Character, Adversary, and Ambient generation are quick and random; adventures reward careful exploration, and combat is sometimes frantic and deadly. The intent is to provide a narrative-forward experience, friendly to any fantasy setting and player expertise level.

## System Reference Document

This repository contains the **System Reference Document** for the core rules of the Gradient RPG System. If used by itself, it serves as an adventure game about traversing underground tunnels, decrepit castles, dark forests, and other dreadful places. Character creation can be entirely random and fast, exploration can be tense and rewarding, and combat can be chaotic and lethal. It assumes a generic fantasy world, embracing full randomness, much like the original Cairn. These rules and procedures can then be inherited by any expansion setting, such as Gradient: Roots, and others to come.
