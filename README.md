# Gradient

>**Gradient** is an open-license, rules-lite, modular adventure game based on [Cairn by Yochai Gal](https://cairnrpg.com/), about exploring a world in movement, filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities.
>
>**Gradient** aims to be setting agnostic, and its core rules do not assume a fantasy genre. **Settings** implement a specific fantasy genre, and reflects that into _Ambients_, _Antagonists_, Character's _Backgrounds_ and _Specializations_, _Inventory_ and _Marketplace_, _Currency_, and more.
>  
>**Ambients**, **Antagonists** and **Characters** can be generated quickly and randomly. Adventures reward thoughtful exploration, while combat is often fast-paced and dangerous. The **Gradient Dice** provides an opportunity for narrative forward dice resolution.
>
>The goal is to offer a narrative-focused experience that welcomes any fantasy setting and any level of player familiarity, blending modern mechanics while remaining fairly rules-lite.

This system takes inspiration from many great sources, including tabletop game systems, fiction books, movies, and other media. Tabletop game systems such as __Genesys__ by Fantasy Flight Games, __Daggerheart__ by Darrington Press, __Apocalypse World__ by Lumpley Games, __Cypher__ by Monte Cook Games, __Dreamscape: Laruna__ by ODAM Publishing, and of course, __Cairn__ by Yochai Gal (and some of its hacks), as well as __Knave__ and __Maze Rats__ by Ben Milton, inspired the team to pursue an old-school RPG feel while also embracing modern ideas and frameworks. Video games such as __Final Fantasy__ and __Chrono Trigger__ by Square Enix, with their varied settings (sometimes within the same game), and books and audiovisual media such as __The Lord of the Rings__ by J.R.R. Tolkien and __The Chronicles of Narnia__ by C.S. Lewis, __The Wheel of Time__ by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, along with many other sources, inspired the team to create a system where stories like these could be co-created by **Players** and **Wardens**.
