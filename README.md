# Gradient

>**Gradient** is an open-license, rules-lite, modular adventure game based on [Cairn 2e by Yochai Gal](https://cairnrpg.com/) and [Maze Rats 4.3 by Ben Milton / Questing Beast Games](https://questingbeast.itch.io/maze-rats), about exploring a world in movement, filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities.

>
>**Gradient** aims to be setting agnostic, and its core rules do not assume a fantasy genre. **Settings** implement a specific fantasy genre, and reflects that into _Antagonists_, _Ambients_, Player Character's _Backgrounds_ and _Specializations_, _Inventory_ and _Marketplace_, _Currency_, and more.
>  
>**Ambients**, **Antagonists** and **Characters** can be generated quickly and randomly. Adventures reward thoughtful exploration, while combat is often fast-paced and dangerous. The **Gradient Dice** provides an opportunity for narrative forward dice resolution.
>
>The goal is to offer a narrative-focused experience that welcomes any fantasy setting and any level of player familiarity, blending modern mechanics while remaining fairly rules-lite.

## System Reference Document

This repository contains the **System Reference Document** for the **Core Rules** of the **Gradient** system, and a generic fantasy **Setting** in **Gradient: Roots**.

## Inspiration

> This system takes inspiration from many great sources, including tabletop game systems, fiction books, movies, and other media.  
> Tabletop game systems such as **Genesys** by _Fantasy Flight Games_, **Daggerheart** by _Darrington Press_, **Apocalypse World** by _Lumpley Games_, **Cypher** by _Monte Cook Games_, **Dreamscape: Laruna** by _ODAM Publishing_, **Knave** and **Maze Rats** by _Ben Milton_, and of course, **Cairn** by _Yochai Gal_ (and some of its hacks), inspired the team to pursue an old-school RPG feel while also embracing modern ideas and frameworks.  
> Video games such as **Final Fantasy** and **Chrono Trigger** by _Square Enix_, with their varied settings (sometimes within the same game).  
> Books and audiovisual media such as **The Lord of the Rings** by _J.R.R. Tolkien_ and **The Chronicles of Narnia** by _C.S. Lewis_, **The Wheel of Time** by _Robert Jordan_ and _Brandon Sanderson_, along with many other sources, inspired the team to create a system where stories like these could be co-created by **Players** and **Wardens**.

# Thanks

This game would not be possible without the openness of the tabletop RPG community, and the work of many creators who have inspired us. A _Special Thanks_ to **Yochai Gal** and **Ben Milton** for their incredible work on **Cairn** and **Maze Rats**, which laid the foundation **Gradient** is built upon. Another _Special Thanks_ to the many creators which have inspired us to create a system that can accommodate the stories we love, and to the many people who have contributed to the development of this game through playtesting, feedback, and support.
