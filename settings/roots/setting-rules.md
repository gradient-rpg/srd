For reference of this processes, see the [Core Rules - Character Creation](/core-rules.md#character-creation).

> Then we roll their setting-specific _Backgrounds_, _Specialization_, _Traits_ and _Inventory_.

### Deprivation and Fatigue

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from **Fatigue**.
- A PC may also be forced to add **Fatigue** after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night’s rest in a safe spot).
- If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

### Inventory

- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **Backpack** that can hold up to six slots of items or **Fatigue**. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment. 
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

#### Inventory Slots

- Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated. 
- _Petty_ items do not take up any slots. _Bulky_ items take up **two** slots. 
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is _petty_ and does not occupy a slot.

### Marketplace

> The setting's **equipment** includes classic medieval fare: swords, axes, bows, armor from gambeson to plate, as well as lanterns, ropes, specialized tools, potions. Many items can be found for sale in towns or marketplaces, with most trade and wages conducted in **gold pieces** (gp), the standard currency of the land. **Hirelings** also have archetypal backgrounds.

For more details, see [Gradient: Roots - Marketplace](marketplace.md).

### Power System

> **Magic** and **Martial Prowess** are the power systems of this setting. **Magic** in Roots is potent but risky, accessible through rare reusable **spellbooks** that anyone can use if they dare, at the cost of **fatigue**. Powerful **relics** imbued with spells also exist, sometimes with unique limitations or requirements, while ephemeral **scrolls** are used up when their magic is unleashed. The rules for magic are simple but dangerous. Its use has a price, and misuse can attract attention or even disaster.
