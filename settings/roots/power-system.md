# Gradient: Roots - Power System

> **Magic** and **Martial Prowess** are the power systems of this medieval fantasy setting.

## Magic

>**Magic** in Roots is potent but risky, accessible through rare reusable **spellbooks** that anyone can use if they dare, at the cost of **fatigue**. Powerful **relics** imbued with spells also exist, sometimes with unique limitations or requirements, while ephemeral **scrolls** are used up when their magic is unleashed. The rules for magic are simple but dangerous. Its use has a price, and misuse can attract attention or even disaster.

### Spellbooks 

- **Spellbooks** contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be easily transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and manors.
- Spellbooks sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or being legible only when held in moonlight.
- Spellbooks will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

### Casting Spells

- Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. They must then add a **Fatigue** to inventory. 
- Given time and safety, PCs can _enhance_ a spell's impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost. 
- If the PC is _deprived_ or in danger (such as during combat), the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect and may result in added **Fatigue**, the destruction of the Spellbook, injury, and even death.

### Scrolls

**Scrolls** are similar to Spellbooks, however:

- They are _petty_.
- They do not cause **Fatigue**.
- They disappear after one use.

### Relics

**Relics** are items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause Fatigue. Relics usually have limited use, as well as a **Recharge** condition.

### Martial Prowess

> Certain Martial Prowess techniques in Roots are as powerful as spells, but achieving them requires acute training, discipline, and much practice. Some of these elite maneuvers or feats may demand a cost in **Fatigue** or even character attributes such as **willpower** or even **strength**, especially when performed in the heat of combat. Using such techniques is as risky and taxing as channeling arcane forces, reflecting the strain and focus needed to push a mortal body to its limits.
