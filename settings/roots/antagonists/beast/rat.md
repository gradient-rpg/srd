# Rat Swarm

#### **Rank 3** (_Swarm_, _Mob_)

_A writhing mass of teeth and fur that surges from sewers and ruins, overwhelming lone prey by sheer numbers._

| HP | STR | DEX | WIL | Attack |
| -- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 | 8 | 7 | bite (d4) |

## Traits

> **Pack Bite**: Rats coordinate their strikes; when one rat in the swarm attacks a target also engaged by other rats, the swarm gains +1 to that attack.

> **Gnaw**: The swarm can chew through light barriers and create openings in soft materials given a short action.
