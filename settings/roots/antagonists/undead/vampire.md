## Traits

> **Regeneration**: A damaged vampire regains 6 HP when it bites a target that has blood. If killed, it becomes a cloud of gas and retreats to its coffin, reforming at the next nightfall. Can only be killed if exposed to sunlight or if the coffin is destroyed.

> **Critical Damage**: The vampire drains the target's essence, dealing d12 damage to WIL. If the target reaches 0 WIL this way, it dies and is raised as a thrall of the vampire.
