# Manticore

#### **Rank 2** (_Stalker_, _Vanguard_, _Tactician_)

_Spiteful monstrosities that wear a humanoid face, a lion's body, wings of a bat, and a scorpion's tail. Dwell in mountainous regions, abandoned castles, and forgotten dungeons._

| HP | STR | DEX | WIL | Attack |
| -- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 15 | 14 | 12 | claws (d6+d6), tail spike (d8) |

## Traits

> Tail spikes act like darts, regrowing after a few days. A single spike is worth 150gp to a collector.

> **Critical Damage**: Target is _deprived_ until they get a good night's sleep. Until then, they act boorish, selfish, and cruel (or more so, if that already is their nature).
