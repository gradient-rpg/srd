## Traits

> **Aerial Dominance**: Rocs can fly for long periods and gain advantage on attacks against grounded foes.

> **Carry Off**: On a critical hit with talons a Roc may attempt to lift and carry a Medium-sized target; the target must succeed on a STR save or be carried off and take d10 fall damage when released.

> **Keen Sight**: Rocs can spot small or hidden creatures from great distances; they automatically succeed on one WIL check per encounter to notice concealed or distant prey.
