# Ossuary
**_Delve_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** supernatural themes, eerie atmosphere, death, non-graphical depictions of violence, claustrophobia

_A vaulted chamber carved from fossilized bone and dusky stone, where rows of standing sarcophagi double as book-shelves and the air hums with the preserved whispers of long-quiet scholars. At the far end, a large bone sarcophagus rests on a dais, its lid etched with fading rituals._

**Local Dynamics:** This ossuary is the final resting place of a fallen heretic priest's most loyal adherents. Their presence lingers as a soft, watchful energy that sustains the room’s quiet order. Moves are met with chilling precision: shadows detach from walls, shelves creak as unseen forces shift, and the dust itself seems to gather into watchful shapes. The place regards visitors as interruptions to its slow routines: subtle shifts in light and sound mark the ossuary’s attention. Those who move with respect may pass unnoticed, but careless clamor or prolonged meddling will draw the ossuary’s guardians to investigate and protect what remains.

## TRAITS
> #### Chill's Hold - Passive:
> The ossuary's ambient magic gently draws warmth and energy from the surroundings. Characters who rest, tend wounds, or exert themselves here may feel unusually tired or chilled; small tasks can feel harder until they warm up again. The effect is subtle and gives the area a hush of fatigue rather than harm.

> #### Echoes of Lost Lore - Passive:
> The scholars’ memories are faintly preserved in the texts and artifacts. Studying a scroll or codex can reveal a forgotten fact or a piece of the priest’s history, but the reader may also experience a lingering mood or impression tied to the author—sadness, obsession, or wonder—that colors their thoughts while they ponder it.

> #### Sarcophagus Stir - Action:
> Occasionally a sarcophagus lid shifts and a guardian figure rises—a statue-like protector clad in ancient robes, moving with creaking precision. These guardians are placed to patrol important paths and valuable shelves; they awaken in response to prolonged presence, loud disturbances, or attempts to handle fragile relics.

> #### Ritual Pulse - Reaction:
> If intruders linger too long near the central sarcophagus or fail to counteract its pulsing energy, a wave of shadowed light ripples through the chamber. The surge temporarily accelerates the ossuary's rhythms: unlit torches flare, dormant skeletal guardians stir and move with greater purpose. If the disturbance continues, the ossuary escalates its defenses.

> #### Protective Ward - Reaction:
> Any attempt to flimsily remove an artifact, force open a sealed sarcophagus, or mishandle a scholar's remains provokes an immediate defensive reaction. The object may snap shut or lurch; a skeletal hand may reach from the nearest opening to grasp or strike, while a chorus of agonized whispers rises—often drawing nearby guardians' attention.

> #### The Priest's Echo - Event:
> A deep, sub-audible vibration has begun to emanate from the central sarcophagus, growing louder and more frequent by the hour. Faint, slurred syllables now echo in the silence between heartbeats. This is the prelude to the heretic priest's planned return—an event that will occur if the players cannot disrupt the accumulating energy or seal the ritual. Should this event achieve critical mass, the ossuary's entire hierarchy will pivot to a single, desperate goal: guarantee the ritual finishes completely and uninterrupted, meaning any intruders will be dealt with swiftly and decisively.
