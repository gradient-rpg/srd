# The Precipice
**_Traversal_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** heights, falling, non-graphical violence

_A near-vertical cliff of weathered stone, scored with cracks, pockets, and narrow ledges. Wind channels along the face, carrying sharp gusts and the hollow echo of distant impacts. The ascent is a test of physical skill and careful judgement: tenuous holds, brittle pitons, and long runs between protection force climbers to balance speed, safety, and endurance._

**Local Dynamics:** This cliff is a brutal, unforgiving obstacle. Success depends on route-finding, efficient movement, good ropework and teamwork; mistakes are often immediate and physical—fractured holds, dislodged gear, and dangerous falls. NPCs found here are practical and battered: a weathered guide offering technical advice, a survivor nursing injuries from a bad swing, or a party bailing out after a long retreat. For PCs, every exposed step demands attention to technique, while small safe ledges become precious moments of relief and recovery.

## TRAITS
> #### Exposure and Echo - Passive:  
> Wind and exposure magnify the sensation of height. Long pauses on exposed positions increase fatigue and vertigo—describe a rising ringing in the ears and a shallowing breath. Mechanically, remaining stationary in an exposed position for extended rounds imposes accumulating penalties to balance and grip, encouraging PCs to plan short, controlled rests at secure points.

> #### Piton Relics - Passive:  
> Rusted iron spikes and old pitons remain embedded from past attempts. They provide marginal protection but their integrity varies. The Warden can call for checks when PCs rely on old gear: some pitons hold, others bend or pull free. Encourage PCs to test placements, back them up with new protection, or use slings and nuts where available.

> #### Rest Stance - Passive:  
> Small ledges, recessed niches, and wider pockets offer moments to recover—recompress lungs, steady ropes, and change pairs. Taking a proper rest here reduces accumulated fatigue and allows minor healing or re-taping of hands. The Warden should reward careful route planning that incorporates these physical relief points.

> #### Deceptive Line - Action:  
> Certain routes look direct and easy from below but are interrupted by loose flakes or overhanging sections. Choosing a line that appears quicker may require a series of precarious moves with little opportunity to place protection. The Warden can present such a line when climbers are pressed for time, forcing a choice between a technically harder but well-protected path and a tempting, exposed shortcut.

> #### Hold Failure - Reaction:  
> Holds can fracture or slip under weight—especially fractured edges, water-worn pockets, or thin flakes. The Warden can trigger a hold failure when a PC makes a high-risk move, carries extra weight, or places sharp torque on a tenuous edge. Failure results in sudden loss of foothold or handhold and may lead to an immediate fall or desperate recovery attempt.

> #### Rockfall - Reaction:  
> Disturbing loose stone or moving above another climber can send pebbles or larger chunks tumbling. A party member dislodging rock may force nearby climbers to make quick reaction checks to avoid being hit or losing balance. Rockfall can also strip marginal holds or bury gear on narrow ledges.
