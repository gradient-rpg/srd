# The Tideway
**_Traversal_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** Claustrophobia, drowning, mechanical crush hazards, suffocation, environmental panic.

_The iron-banded tunnel smells of wet stone and rust, its floor a slick of algae and old filth. At irregular intervals, massive watertight gates groan open and shut, flooding or draining sections with bone-chilling efficiency, while archaic lift platforms shudder upwards on chain-driven pulleys, their switches embedded in the wall like sacrificial altars._

**Local Dynamics:** This is a forgotten municipal artery, its water cycles dictated by a slow geomantic pulse in the stone—old, predictable shifts in the rock and water—or exploited by a hidden society that uses the channels for smuggling. The few transient inhabitants are either the underpaid municipal workers called "Tenders" who keep the failing infrastructure running in oily rags, or the "Runners": members of a thieves' guild who navigate the channels for profit and contraband. They both view outsiders as variables: either useful hands to pull a lever or risky unknowns who might disrupt the delicate, deadly delivery schedule. PCs will be assessed for their utility and their threat to the cycle; hesitation is punished by rising water, while boldness might earn a grudging guide or a sabotaged lift.

## TRAITS
> #### Rising Tide - Passive:  
> The water level in the tunnel sections changes on a fixed, unknown cycle. When the water rises, it slows movement, muffles sound, and threatens to submerge low passages. When it falls, previously flooded areas become navigable but leave behind treacherous slime and hidden debris. The Warden can track this cycle in secret, describing subtle clues (a fresh watermark, a change in air smell) that observant PCs can learn to predict, turning the ambient's heartbeat into a puzzle to solve.

> #### Echo Chamber - Passive:  
> The stone tunnels magnify and distort sound. Normal conversation carries abnormally far, while shouts become deafening, disorienting echoes. This passive benefits PCs who move quietly and plan communications, but makes stealth nearly impossible and can attract attention from distant denizens or cause panic in claustrophobic characters. The Warden should describe how sounds behave—a dropped tool might sound like it came from around the next bend.

> #### The Grinding Lift - Action:  
> A lift platform suddenly jams, its chains screaming under strain. The Warden can introduce this when PCs are mid-transit or attempting to use a switch, forcing a tense scene of repair or escape. The lift might lower dangerously fast, crush something in its path, or seal a section of tunnel. This action embodies the ambient's decaying machinery—it doesn't attack, it just fails, and the environment does the damage.

> #### Chain Reaction - Action:  
> A water gate fails to seal properly elsewhere in the system, causing a violent, unpredictable surge of water to rush through a side tunnel or breach a weak wall. The Warden can trigger this hours after a PC carelessly damaged machinery or as a direct consequence of a failed repair attempt. It demonstrates that the ambient is a connected, fragile system—actions here have delayed, cascading consequences.

> #### Switch Sentinels - Reaction:  
> If a PC operates a large wall switch without first checking for function or traps, the mechanism retaliates. This may be a hidden piston that slams the switch (and the PC's hand) into place, a burst of steam from a ruptured pipe, or the sudden activation of a nearby water gate. It reinforces that the ambient's controls are hazards, not conveniences.

> #### Silent Agreement - Reaction:  
> If PCs demonstrate they understand and respect the water cycle's rhythm—by waiting for a gate to close before proceeding, using a lift exactly as intended, or sharing found knowledge with a Tender—a nearby scavenger or Tender might silently offer a crucial piece of information: a shortcut, a warning about an upcoming flush, or the location of a less-obvious switch. This reaction rewards observation and patience, treating the ambient as a negotiation with its rules rather than a force to overcome.

> #### The Tender's Mark - Event:  
> A grimy symbol, painted with oily sludge, glows faintly on a wall near a critical switch. It marks a section currently "safe" from the next water cycle — knowledge held by the Tenders. If PCs notice and understand it, they gain a short-lived sanctuary or strategic advantage (enough to wait out the next flush or perform a quick repair). If they deface or misuse it, Tenders may mark them as reckless, inviting sabotage.
