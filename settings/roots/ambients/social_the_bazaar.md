# The Bazaar
**_Social_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** exploitation, theft/extortion, harassment/intimidation, social manipulation, organized crime

_A river of people and goods churns through narrow, sun‑baked avenues. The air is thick with spice smoke, hot metal, sweat, and the sharp tang of exotic fruit. Canvas awnings form a patchwork ceiling, casting shifting shadows over stalls overflowing with ceramics, cloth, glass, and strange curios._

**Local Dynamics:** This place runs on transactional hunger. Merchants see everyone as a wallet to be opened; guards see every crowd as a potential disorder; thieves see every pause as an opportunity. The bazaar owes no loyalties—it bends to the highest bidder and discards the rest. PCs arrive as customers or marks: their coin is welcome, but ignorance of local custom or a failure to project credible value makes them vulnerable to exploitation, shakedowns, or invisibility. Respect here is bartered, not given.

## TRAITS

> #### Scent of the Deal - Passive:
> The overwhelming, specific smells of the bazaar—a particular spice blend, roasting nuts, tanned leather—can be used by a PC to gain a subtle advantage in a negotiation or perception check. To invoke this, the PC must first spend time intentionally seeking out and identifying that scent among the chaos, making themselves momentarily conspicuous to observant stall-keepers.

> #### The Curiosity Container - Action:
> A merchant, eager for a sale or a story, reveals a small locked or marked container and claims it holds something intriguing: a preserved desert insect, a sealed foreign letter, or a warm seed. They'll trade it for something the PCs might undervalue—an odd trinket, a promise to perform later, or a memorable story told aloud—creating a small, roleplayable exchange.

> #### The Shakedown - Action:
> A handful of rough porters or fencehands subtly corral the party. Their leader smiles without warmth and demands a "market tax" for such prominent customers: a modest item (a waterskin, a good knife, a cloak) or a fixed coin sum. Refusal escalates to harassment, blocked paths, and whispers that the PCs are bad luck for merchants.

> #### The Crowd Parts - Reaction:
> If a PC becomes separated and pushes urgently against the flow, the crowd thins just enough to let them through, then closes behind them and carries them in a new direction. The crowd is not malicious—its currents are indifferent—but isolation increases the risk of being moved, observed, or picked out by opportunists.

> #### Guild Inspection Imminent - Event:
> Merchant's Guild inspectors are due within hours. Stall‑owners hide illicit goods, polish wares to a mirror sheen, and rehearse humble faces. The bazaar falls into a tense calm—any loud argument, unregistered weapon, or overtly suspicious activity will draw sharp, professional scrutiny from inspectors and guards eager to fine or make an example.
