# The Temple
**_Social_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** moral dilemmas, ethical conflict, divinity, faith, religious zealotry

_The air in the Temple is thick with sweet incense and the murmur of a hundred whispered prayers. Sunlight filters through stained glass, painting the polished stone floor in shifting columns of color, while soft hymns from hidden choirs provide a constant, comforting hum. Pilgrims line the pews, some prostrate in supplication, others sitting quietly in exhausted relief, all under the watchful eyes of robed clergy._

**Local Dynamics:** The temple operates on a strict, unspoken economy of faith and favor. The clergy are gatekeepers of divine power; their primary drives are to maintain the sanctity of the space, display their deity's tangible benevolence to bolster belief, and manage the flow of desperate souls seeking miracles. They will instinctively view the party as either potential assets to bolster the temple's reputation through pious acts or useful tools to be directed toward a service, or as disruptive elements whose faith (or lack thereof) must be interrogated and corrected. For the players, this means every interaction is measured: a show of genuine devotion may open doors and earn quiet aid, while skepticism or disrespect will be met with cold scrutiny, redirected efforts, or subtle coercion to conform to the temple's sacred rhythm.

## TRAITS
> #### Sustaining Resonance - Passive:  
> The ambient harmony of prayer and consecrated space grants a profound, quiet resilience. Those who take a moment to truly listen to the hymns or meditate in a sunbeam may find their spirits steadied, able to push through exhaustion or despair with a clarity born of the sacred calm. A PC who does so restores lost HP. The benefit requires a genuine, invested pause—not just passing through—and the clergy will notice and appreciate such sincere receptivity.

> #### Echoes of the Divine - Passive:  
> The temple walls seem to hold the residue of past miracles and fervent prayers. A character who focuses on a specific shrine, altar, or relic, pouring their own honest need or question into the silence, might receive an intuitive nudge, a sudden vivid memory, or a word that perfectly fits their quandary. This guidance is subtle and metaphorical, not a direct answer, and is more likely for those whose intent aligns with the temple's professed virtues.

> #### The Clergy's Calculus - Action:  
> A senior priest or seraph may approach the party not with a request, but with an assessment. This is a moment of quiet judgment: they will ask pointed questions about the party's purpose, moral standing, or recent deeds, their tone polite but their gaze unwavering. The intent is to categorize the group—are they worthy champions of the faith, lost sheep to be guided, or potential heretics to be watched? This action sets the tone for all future interactions with the temple's leadership.

> #### A Test of Faith - Action:  
> The temple's routine is suddenly interrupted by a clear, small-scale crisis that demands intervention: a frantic pilgrim has had a cherished relic stolen from the prayer hall, sounds of fighting erupt from the guarded scriptorium, or a healing ward flickers and fails for a critically ill person. The clergy are momentarily distracted or paralyzed by doctrine, implicitly (or explicitly) looking to the party to resolve it. How they handle it—with violence, cunning, or compassion—will define their reputation within these walls.

> #### Unholy Disturbance - Reaction:  
> Should a character openly mock a rite, desecrate an altar, or show violent intent within the main worship space, the very atmosphere seems to recoil. Candles gutter, a chill draft extinguishes nearby flames, and every head turns. A low, dissonant hum rises from the stone itself, and a pair of serene but utterly immovable temple guards will rush towards the room's entrance, their expressions not angry but profoundly disappointed and firm. They will not attack, but they will bar the way and demand an explanation, their presence a silencing weight.

> #### The Grand Consecration - Event:  
> The temple is preparing for, or is in the midst of, a major cyclical ritual—perhaps a Blessing of the Waters, an Ascension Day ceremony, or a memorial for a fallen hero. The entire building thrums with heightened spiritual energy. During this time, passive divine guidance becomes sharper and more frequent, but the temple is also exquisitely sensitive to disruption. Any act perceived as blasphemous will draw immediate, overwhelming clerical attention, while demonstrating piety during the ritual could earn the party a unique, potent blessing from the high priest. The event creates a palpable pressure, a sense that the divine is listening very, very closely.
