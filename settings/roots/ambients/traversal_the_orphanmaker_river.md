# The Orphanmaker River
**_Traversal_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** Drowning, hypothermia, non-graphical violence, predatory animals

_A churning, silt-heavy river moves with a relentless muscle, its surface broken by standing waves and hidden rocks. No bridge spans it here—only a few slick, missing stones and the memory of those who tried to ford it._

**Local Dynamics:** The river is not malicious, merely indifferent; it follows its ancient course to the sea, and anything in its way is either moved or broken. Those who live nearby treat it as a fickle god—ferrymen know the safe eddies, hunters watch its banks for the creatures it stirs, and bandits use its roar as cover for ambushes. For travelers, the river is a barrier that judges strength and humility. NPCs will warn of the safe path, offer costly guidance, or simply watch, knowing the water will decide who passes and who is claimed.

## TRAITS
> #### The Meat of the Current - Passive:  
> The river’s pull varies by the hour and the season. To cross safely, a traveler should secure something solid—a rope, a sturdy staff, a companion’s hand—and then commit to a sequence of sustained efforts: finding a path, bracing against a surge, and finally heaving themselves onto the far bank (teamwork can grant advantage or reduced penalties). The river does not allow hasty or solitary attempts; each step risks being undone by the next wave. The Warden can narrate each success as a temporary triumph over the water’s draw, and a failure as a setback that costs ground or gear.

#### Guided Crossing - Passive:
Local ferrymen, guides, or marked fords provide a safer (but not risk-free) option to cross. Hiring a guide, following a marked path, or using an established rope line reduces the severity of Sudden Strain and Hidden Snag (Warden may grant advantage, or allow one reroll). Guides can demand payment, a favor, or require social checks to convince.

> #### Sudden Strain - Action:  
> Without warning, the river’s flow deepens or a submerged log spins into a traveler’s legs. The Warden can trigger this when a PC is focused on crossing, forcing a moment of desperate balance or a struggle to keep their head above water. This is not an attack from a creature, but the river itself correcting its course, testing a traveler’s grip and resolve. It can separate party members, carry away an unsecured item, or simply exhaust them before they reach the other side.

> #### Hidden Snag - Action:  
> A visible rock or a seemingly calm stretch of water conceals a submerged obstruction—a tangle of roots, a collapsed bank, a crate from a recent wreck. The Warden can reveal this as a PC commits to a crossing, turning a confident step into a sudden plunge or a stuck foot. This trait represents the river’s shifting anatomy; what was safe yesterday may today be a trap. It can leave a PC vulnerable while they free themselves, or pinning them in place as the current tugs.

> #### Overconfidence - Reaction:  
> If a PC dismisses the river’s danger, makes a boast about their swimming, or attempts to cross without securing their gear, the water responds with disproportionate force. A splash may become a wave, a steady current may suddenly pull them under. The Warden can use this when a PC’s dialogue or action shows arrogance, turning their certainty into a struggle. The river does not hate them—it simply does not suffer fools, and it will remind them of their place.

> #### River’s Offer - Action:  
> The river periodically delivers what it has taken: a bloated carcass, a waterlogged satchel, a piece of lumber from a distant forest. The Warden can introduce these as the party watches the water, washing up on the shore or floating past. These objects hint at the river’s wider connections and past violence. They may be useful (a dry flint and tinder in a sealed box), grim (a traveler’s last letter), or simply puzzling (a perfectly preserved, out-of-place flower). They are the river’s quiet, constant narration.

> #### Thaw or Drought - Event:  
> The river’s character changes with the season or after a distant storm. In spring, it swells with meltwater, loud and brown, carrying whole trees. In a dry summer, it becomes a series of shallow, treacherous pools connected by weak flows, exposing more snags but making the crossing longer. This ongoing condition colors every attempt to cross. The Warden should decide the current state and let it influence all other traits—a drought makes Hidden Snag more common but Sudden Strain less severe; a flood makes every step a battle against The Meat of the Current.
