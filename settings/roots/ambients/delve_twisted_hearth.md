# Twisted Hearth
**_Delve_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** supernatural themes, eerie atmosphere, nature corrupted, non-graphical depictions of violence

_A once-sacred druidic grove, now choked with aggressive vines and haunted by the echoes of a violent past. The air hums with feral magic, and the trees themselves seem to watch with predatory patience._

**Local Dynamics:** The grove is a wounded entity—twisted dryads and angry treants guard it, driven by trauma and a desperate need to protect the remaining purity. They perceive all outsiders as potential violators, shaped by the memory of a betrayal that scarred the land. PCs will be met with immediate distrust and hostility; any perceived slight or careless act may provoke a violent response, while sincere acts of reverence or offers to aid the grove's healing might slowly turn the guardians from foes to wary allies, though their paranoia will never fully fade.

## TRAITS

> #### Echoes in the Bark - Passive:  
> The grove permanently records emotional imprints of past events. A PC who spends time quietly observing a spot may experience a vivid sensory flash of the battle that occurred there. This knowledge is unfiltered and emotional, not a clean report. Gaining this insight requires stillness and attention, making the observer  vulnerable to other ambient dangers.

> #### The Grasping Spring - Passive:  
> Natural springs and rain-filled crevices throughout the grove feed tangled, slick roots that form unpredictable mires. Moving quickly or recklessly through low-lying areas risks sudden, deep suction. A PC who stops to assess the ground or uses a long stick to probe ahead may find a safe path, but the act of testing slows progress and draws attention from the grove's quieter watchers. The ground itself seems to shift, closing gaps and opening new ones when not directly observed.

> #### Sudden, Snapping Vines - Action:  
> A mass of barbed vines lashes out from a seemingly dormant thicket toward a PC who is distracted, separated, or has recently spoken loudly. The vines seek to entangle and drag, not necessarily kill. This is the grove's reflexive defense, a non-lethal but terrifying warning. The Warden can describe the vines emerging from shadow, damp earth, or even the bark of a nearby tree, emphasizing the ambient's seamless aggressive protection.

> #### The Guardian's Stare - Action:  
> A corrupted dryad or minor treant steps from the foliage, not to immediately attack, but to impose a tense, silent scrutiny. It does not speak the PCs' language but conveys clear intent through posture, pointing toward the grove's exit. It offers a single, non-negotiable demand: leave now, and never return. Should the PCs refuse or attempt to parley, it calls for reinforcement, and the confrontation escalates. This action can be used by the Warden to reset a scene, force a decision, or reveal the guardians' disciplined hierarchy.

> #### Unclean Offering - Reaction:  
> If a PC takes an item from the grove—a unique mushroom, a strangely shaped stone, a fallen branch with crystalline growths—the entire ambient subtly turns against them. The wind dies, birdsong ceases, and the remaining guardians' targeting becomes instantly focused and personal. The taken object may feel warm or emit a faint hum, marking the thief. Returning the item with an act of deference (placing it back where found, offering a personal token in exchange) may placate the grove, but the item is forever tainted in its eyes.

> #### The Twilight Replay - Event:  
> As dusk settles, the grove periodically and briefly re-emanates the final moments of the old battle. Ghostly, silent figures clash in the same spots where real bodies fell. These visions are not interactive but leave physical traces — a sudden chill, disturbed earth, or a phantom scent of burnt herbs. The event peaks for a few minutes before fading. It is both a clue and a lure, attracting the grove's more aggressive inhabitants who become agitated and more likely to hunt during these recollections.
