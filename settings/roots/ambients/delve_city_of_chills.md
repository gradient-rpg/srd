# City of Chills
**_Delve_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** death, grief, traumatic reenactment, non-graphical depictions of violence

_A city of silent stone and phantom whispers, where the air thickens with the scent of hearths long-extinguished and the architecture warps subtly to match forgotten eras. Ghostly silhouettes drift through plazas that once bustled, their forms flickering like candle flames in a draft._

**Local Dynamics:** The city’s ghosts are frozen in their final moments—soldiers turning toward unseen enemies, merchants clawing at locked doors, a small figure reaching for a vanished hand. They aren’t malevolent so much as trapped by their endings: to them the living are either intruders who might finish their story or new actors to cast into old tragedies. The city itself reinforces these patterns, reshaping to keep visitors entangled.

## TRAITS

> #### Shifting Foundations - Passive:
> The city’s layout breathes. A doorway that was on the left moments ago may now be on the right, or a familiar square might open into an entirely different district from another century. The Warden can subtly change maps between scenes or have paths vanish behind the party. Navigating requires letting go of a fixed sense of place and reading the emotional “logic” of the hauntings—a street of mourning may lead toward a plaza of defiance, for instance. Progress is made by interpreting the ghosts’ stories, not by trusting the geography.

> #### Scene of the Ending - Action:
> A ghostly vignette solidifies around the party, replaying a specific moment of catastrophe—a wall of flame rushes down a street, a chorus of screams erupts from a theater, or a silent, poisoned fog settles in a garden. The ambient itself imposes this scene, forcing the party to either flee through it, endure it, or find a way to step around the “stage” where it plays out. The scene follows the internal logic of that ghost’s memory; fire here might feel cold, or a collapsing building might let sound pass through it unimpeded.

> #### Echo of Self - Reaction:
> If a player expresses strong emotion—despair, hope, anger, longing—a nearby ghost may latch onto that feeling and manifest a personal echo tailored to that character. A hopeful PC might see a ghostly version of themselves achieving a long-sought goal, only for it to crumble. A despairing PC might be offered discouragement by a ghost who believes they should have no hope for success. This is not an attack, but a mirror; the ghost is trying to resolve its own feeling by sharing it, and the PC must resist being subsumed by the echo’s narrative.

> #### The Recurring Cataclysm - Event:
> At some point, the ambient will trigger the reenactment of some disaster—a great fire, a rebellion’s bloody end, a magical collapse. The sky darkens, sounds distort, and the city’s architecture begins to fail in recognizable patterns from the past. This is not a random event but the city’s heartbeat. It may last minutes or hours, and it will force everyone to confront the same raw trauma that affected the city’s inhabitants. Surviving it requires recognizing the pattern and finding a “stable” point—a cellar that never flooded, a statue that always stood, a source of light that never wavered—whatever is not being affected by the cataclysm anchors one outside the replay.
