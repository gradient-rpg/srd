# Lost Map Cavern
**_Delve_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** claustrophobia, ancient curses, sudden collapses, entrapment, non-graphic violence

_Lost Map Cavern is a warren of damp, silent grottoes where the walls are a tapestry of worn, angular glyphs. Sunlight or torchlight, when angled just so across specific carvings, can shift unseen stone, revealing narrow passages or provoking a low, resonant hum from the deep rock._

**Local Dynamics:** The cavern is not abandoned, but dormant—a failed sanctuary or sealed vault built by a long-gone people. The glyphs are not mere decoration but a fractured security and ritual system, still subtly active. The few remaining scavengers or curious explorers who find their way here operate in a tense, silent dance, moving by rote memory or desperate guesswork, terrified of setting off a final lock or waking something that should have stayed asleep. For PCs, every light source and touch is a potential trigger; the place will judge them as either new cipher-keepers to be tested or grave-robbers to be sealed away with its secrets.

## TRAITS
> #### Silent Geometry - Passive:  
> The glyphs form a silent, logical language. PCs who take time to sketch, trace, or systematically study patterns in one chamber gain an intuitive sense for the next likely hidden mechanism or safe path, but the act demands stillness and focus that leaves them vulnerable to ambushes or environmental shifts elsewhere.

> #### Light-Lock - Action:  
> A beam of light strikes a specific glyph at an unexpected moment (dawn through a crack, a torch flare), causing a deep grinding sound. A previously sealed archway grinds open, a hidden pit snaps shut, or a previously silent glyph flares with cold, painful light that sears the eyes of anyone directly in its beam.

> #### Glyph-Resonance - Reaction:  
> If a PC carelessly damages, defaces, or applies force to a glyph-bearing surface without understanding its pattern, the affected glyph and all connected glyphs within the grotto hum violently. This can cause minor tremors, collapse weakened stone, or attract the attention of the cavern's genuinely awakened, patient guardian from its slumber.

> #### Echo-Keeper - Event (Present):  
> A solitary, twitchy explorer or a small, desperate band of scavengers is already inside, moving with fragile confidence through a known path. They are performing a risky, precise light-angle maneuver to reach their hidden cache. If the PCs encounter them, they will be fiercely territorial, demanding the PCs leave or help, and are dangerously close to a catastrophic misstep that could seal their fate and alter the cavern's layout.

> #### The Final Glyph - Event (Imminent):  
> The deepest, central chamber contains a single, massive, unfinished glyph. It is faintly, troublingly warm. If the PCs complete its missing segments—whether through insight, force, or accident—the cavern's core logic will perceive them as the old masters. This triggers a profound, chamber-wide reconfiguration: new passages open, old ones vanish, and a dormant, terrible purpose—perhaps a backup custodial entity or a catastrophic purging ritual—will begin its countdown, viewing the PCs as the authority to enact or stop it.
