# Icy Sigil Ridge

**_Traversal_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** hypothermia, burial, predatory/territorial animals, disorientation, non-graphical violence

_A winding stone path clings to a mountainside scarred with glowing sigils, where biting winds knife through razor-sharp turns and the distant cries of giant eagles echo off sheer cliffs._

**Local Dynamics:** The sigils were etched by the Wardens of the Ridge, an old wizard guild who once bound the mountain’s fury into carved runes to keep the pass travelable. The guild has long since disbanded and their wards are slowly fading; where a rune once held steady, it now flickers and fails without warning. This decay is what makes the traversal dangerous: a sigil’s brief spark or sudden silence can soothe a gust, tear the wind into knives, or loosen an ancient shelf of ice. Travelers move with grim urgency—some hoping to rekindle a sigil’s hum, others fearing that a flicker will trigger collapse. The pass feels watchful and brittle, and the eagles act as the mountain’s indifferent wardens.

## TRAITS

> #### Forgotten Shelves - Passive:
> In the lee of most sigils, previous travelers have carved shallow caves and anchored handholds into the rock. These offer brief, crucial respite from wind and eagle sight, but their entrances are often masked by ice or disguised by the mountain’s irregular face. Finding and reaching them requires a keen eye and steady footing, and they provide only temporary safety before the next gust or eagle patrol.

> #### Wasting Winds - Passive:
> The enchanted winds do more than chill—they erode. Characters exposed for extended periods without proper shelter or layered clothing find their joints stiffening, their ropes frosting brittle, and their thoughts clouding with fatigue. Gear becomes cumbersome, and simple tasks like tying a knot grow difficult. The cold is a slow, creeping adversary that demands constant motion or refuge.

> #### The Mountain’s Sigh - Action:
> When some sigils flicker, they cause a deep groan to resonate through the pass as a shelf of glacial ice or a weakened stone face gives way. This may trigger a distant avalanche or simply rain down a shower of ice and pebbles onto the path below, forcing those beneath to scramble for cover or be pummeled. The sound itself is a warning—and a lure for circling eagles.

> #### Sigil Flare - Action or Reaction:
> When a sigil flickers, or a traveler carelessly touches, disturbs, attempts to alter a sigil without knowledge of what they're doing, it can flare with a cold, blue-white light that momentarily illuminates the entire pass. Because the wards are failing, a flare can have unpredictable results: it may soothe the wind for a heartbeat, or lash back—drawing eagles, loosening an old ledge, triggering an icefall, or producing a localized surge of bitter cold. The flare is the mountain’s alarm and a sign the rune’s binding is failing.

> #### Eagle’s Notice - Reaction:
> If the party lingers in an exposed section of the path or makes loud noise, a pair of giant eagles will spiral down from their high-aerie nests to investigate. They do not attack immediately but circle at a distance, their shrill calls echoing, testing the party’s defenses andresources. They are curious, territorial, and hungry, and their presence turns a quiet stretch of path into a tense, watched ordeal.

> #### Warden’s Anchor - Reaction:
> When a character studies multiple nearby sigils and successfully discerns a stabilizing pattern (GM adjudicates an appropriate Lore, Arcana, or Survival check), they can use a reaction to call a Warden’s Anchor. The anchor briefly reasserts a steady binding around the party: winds calm, eagles are discouraged from close approach, and the group may take a short rest (10–15 minutes) sheltered from immediate hazards. Each anchor is tied to a place and, once used, cannot be triggered again at that location until the next dawn.
