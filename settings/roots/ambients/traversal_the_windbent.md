# The Windbent
**_Traversal_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** heights, falling, injury, death, panic

*The Windbent is an old bridge, a skeletal remnant of timber, its planks warped and gapped, constantly hammered by a shrieking wind that seems to lean into every crossing. The air smells of wet rot and cold stone, and each gust carries the groan of overstressed wood.*

**Local Dynamics:** The bridge is not merely old—it is actively hostile, as if the wind and decay have merged into a single intent to dislodge travelers. Those who cross are treated as violations of a fragile equilibrium; the wind amplifies any misstep, and the wood will buckle where weight is placed. PCs will feel the bridge resisting them, not through malice but through an impersonal, relentless geometry of collapse.

## TRAITS
> #### Unstable Footing - Passive:  
> Some planks are not nailed but loosely laid, rocking and tilting with each step. A PC who moves quickly or runs risks a plank tipping violently, throwing their balance off. Those who proceed with extreme caution may find a temporarily stable rhythm, but the effort slows progress dramatically and draws the wind’s attention. The gorge funnels powerful crosswinds that push sideways against anyone on the bridge. PCs must constantly adjust their stance and grip; trying to move against the wind requires anchoring to something solid, but any handhold could be as rotten as the decking.

> #### Sturdy Lintel - Passive:
> Hidden among the rotten beams are occasional, well-preserved supports. Once per crossing, a character may find and brace against one such lintel, gaining advantage on a single saving roll or reducing fall distance.

> #### Plank Failure - Action:  
> A specific plank under a PC’s foot splinters and collapses, dropping them partly through the deck. This isn't just a stumble—it creates a new, immediate gap and may dangle the PC by a limb. The Warden can decide if this failure was inevitable or timed to coincide with a distraction or a loud noise.

> #### Momentary Lull - Action:
> At the Warden's discretion, the wind may ease for a breath. During this lull (one turn), characters can move without Wind Shear penalties or take a single free minor action to stabilize gear or assist an ally.

> #### Leverage Point - Reaction:  
> A PC who braces against a support beam or rope to withstand the wind may find their chosen anchor point failing. The beam might splinter, the rope might fray and snap, or the entire section of railing they hold could tear away. This reaction turns a moment of supposed security into a new crisis.
