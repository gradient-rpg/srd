# Deadwood
**_Delve_**

**Content Warning / Triggers:** War, chemical warfare, environmental devastation, reanimation, undead creatures, death, decay, toxic environments, non-graphical depictions of violence.

_A once-peaceful woodland now scarred by cataclysmic war—twisted stumps weep black sap, skeletal trees claw at a sky choked with chemical mist, and undead beasts stalk the fog, their eyes burning with a feral hunger. The air tastes of iron and decay, and the ground occasionally trembles as if with the echoes of forgotten battles._

**Local Dynamics:** An unnatural wound in the land, which until not long ago was just a sad, dead place. More recently, something shifted. Its old corruption, fueled by residual battle magic and chemical toxins has been stirred anew. The undead flora and fauna became mindless; driven by a collective rage and hunger stemming from new violent energies. Any living presence is seen as an intruder to be consumed or a potential source of relief to be exploited. Those who remain living—scavengers, hermits, or lingering spirits—are either desperate to escape the wood’s grasp or bound to its agony, viewing newcomers as either saviors or fresh fuel for the endless hunger.

## TRAITS
> #### War-Ash Haze - Passive:  
> The chemical-laden mist clings to skin and clothing, tinting vision with ghostly afterimages and carrying whispers of the fallen. Those who move with purpose and cover their mouths may navigate without drawing too much attention, but coughing, shouting, or rushing causes the haze to thicken, revealing their position to the wood’s predators.

> #### The Wounded Stone - Passive:  
> At the wood’s heart lies a recently re-lit magical monolith, oozing dark energy—an once still remnant of the battle’s magical fallout, now emitting renewed dark energies. Something, someone refueled it. Spending time near it might reveal glimpses of the cataclysm that created this place, but the exposure leaves a psychic stain that makes the undead more aware of the observer’s presence over time.

> #### Grasping Bramble-Coffins - Action:  
> When the wood’s anger flares—triggered by loud noises, bright lights, or the presence of living energy—dead vines erupt from the blackened soil, weaving into barbed tendrils that lash out to ensnare and drain vitality. They seek to pull victims into the waiting maw of the corrupted earth.

> #### Skeletal War-Beasts - Action:  
> From the mist emerge the region’s undead wildlife: skeletal deer with antlers of jagged bone, bears with fur of matted shadows, and wolves whose howls are silent but send chills through the soul. They move in coordinated, predatory silence, herding intruders toward the Wounded Stone or isolating the weak.

> #### Marching Echoes - Reaction:  
> If a character attempts to replicate the wood’s haunting rhythms—the distant drum of war, the chants of long-dead soldiers, or the hum of unstable magic—the land may respond. A respectful, subdued mimicry might temporarily pacify nearby undead, allowing stealthy passage. A bold or mocking rendition will instantly summon the attention of every predator in the vicinity, drawn by the audacity.

> #### Flare of the Wood - Event:  
> The wood’s corruption waxes and wanes in unpredictable waves. During a flare, the mist glows with a sickly-green hue, the Wounded Stone pulses visibly, and all undead within the area become frenzied, their hunger intensifying and their movements faster. During a lull, the undead grow sluggish and the mist thin, offering a brief window for travel or investigation.

> #### Necrotic Outcropping - Event:  
> Sporadic eruptions of necrotic energy burst from the ground, spewing toxic spores that rapidly reanimate any dead matter in the vicinity. These outcroppings spread if left unchecked, creating new pockets of heightened undead activity that force travelers to alter their path or face increased aggression.
