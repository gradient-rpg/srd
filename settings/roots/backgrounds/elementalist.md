# Background: Wizard
> You are a scholar of the arcane, or just naturally gifted. Either way, you handle spells and magic like no one else.

## Signature Move
**Grimoire** (_Bulky_ inventory item). This is the fruit of your research and your most precious belongings (only you can decipher it). You can spend four hours to copy a standard Spellbook into your **Grimoire** followed by a successful **WIL Save**. During this process the original Spellbook is destroyed. Scrolls cannot be copied.
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 STR, +1 WIL
## Hit Protection Modifier
- 0

# Specialization: Elementalist
> You muster the arcane forces of the four elements: Water, Earth, Fire and Air. You can attune to one element: You always have 3 **Armor** against it and your attack spells based on it are _enhanced_. You can study and concentrate for eight hours and change your attunement. You can summon an **Elemental Sprite** that deals 1d6 damage when it attacks.
