# Background: Wizard
> You are a scholar of the arcane, or just naturally gifted. Either way, you handle spells and magic like no one else.

## Signature Move
**Grimoire** (_Bulky_ inventory item). This is the fruit of your research and your most precious belongings (only you can decipher it). You can spend four hours to copy a standard Spellbook into your **Grimoire** followed by a successful **WIL Save**. During this process the original Spellbook is destroyed. Scrolls cannot be copied.
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 STR, +1 WIL
## Hit Protection Modifier
- 0

# Specialization: Battle Mage
> You are an avid student of martial magic, imbuing arcane into blade and body. Once a day you can choose to either imbue your weapon with elemental power—your attacks become _enhanced_, OR you can imbue your body, gaining +2 Armor. You can overpower yourself doing both at the same time, at the cost of half your **WIL**, and being unable to use arcane imbuiment the next whole day.
