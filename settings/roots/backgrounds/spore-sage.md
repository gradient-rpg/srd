# Background: Druid
> You belong to the wild lands and feel uncomfortable in cities. You have faith in the elements and legendary beasts of old. You can **communicate with animals, plants and fungi** and always **find resources in the wilderness**. 

## Signature Move
**Primal Resilience**: You have +1 Armor when in natural environments (forests, swamps, wilderness)
**Natural Healing**: Once per day you can heal 1d4 STR as an action.
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 DEX, +1 WIL
## Hit Protection Modifier
- 0

# Specialization: Spore Sage
> You are an avid student of **rot and decay**, and the cycle of decomposition. Once per rest, you can release a **cloud of spores** that affects all creatures in 20ft—choose one effect: _sleep_ (WIL save), _poison_ (1d4 STR damage), or _hallucination_ (WIL save). You are **immune to all poisons**. When you kill a living creature, mushrooms sprout from their body—you can harvest these for 1d4 rations or alchemical ingredients. You smell of earth and decay, and most find it unsettling.
