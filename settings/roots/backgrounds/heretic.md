# Specialization: Heretic
> You are not welcome in most temples, as they do not share your beliefs. But you hold your truth close: only the most holy warriors have mind and spirit strong enough to walk a path like yours without succumbing to darkness.

You are an avid student of corrupting magic, and can cast **Prayer of Madness**, inflicting **1d6 WIL damage** to a target within 30ft (bypassing armor). When you kill an enemy, you can choose to **absorb** their dwindling life force to **recover 1d4 HP** for the **cost of 1 Fatigue**.
