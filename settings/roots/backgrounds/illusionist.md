## Signature Move
**Grimoire** (_Bulky_ inventory item). This is the fruit of your research and your most precious belongings (only you can decipher it). You can spend four hours to copy a standard Spellbook into your **Grimoire** followed by a successful **WIL Save**. During this process the original Spellbook is destroyed. Scrolls cannot be copied.

# Specialization: Illusionist
