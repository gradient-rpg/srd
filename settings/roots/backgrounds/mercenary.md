# Background: Warrior
> You are the master of the arts of combat and warfare. Humanoid antagonists fear you, and have _impaired_ morale saves.

## Signature Move
**Whirlwind**: Do a _Blast_ attack with your weapon and gain 1 Fatigue
**I can do this all day**: When you kill or critically damage an enemy, you can attack again immediately
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 DEX, +1 STR
## Hit Protection Modifier
- +1

# Specialization: Mercenary
> You have a **contact** you can turn to in almost every city. They aren't always happy to see you, though. **Coin** is your motivation and you've learned to fight dirty when the pay is right. You always pass **morale saves in combat**, as you've seen too much to flee at this point in life. Once per day, when you _drop an enemy to 0 HP_, you gain a reaction to **intimidate their allies**: they must make a morale save or flee. You're an avid student of practical warfare and can assess the value of weapons, armor, and military tactics at a glance. You can trade weapons, armor and hire hirelings at a discount.
