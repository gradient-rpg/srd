# Background: Warrior
> You are the master of the arts of combat and warfare. Humanoid antagonists fear you, and have _impaired_ morale saves.

## Signature Move
**Whirlwind**: Do a _Blast_ attack with your weapon and gain 1 Fatigue
**I can do this all day**: When you kill or critically damage an enemy, you can attack again immediately
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 DEX, +1 STR
## Hit Protection Modifier
- +1

# Specialization: Champion
> You are an avid student of combat as an art form. Your favorite weapon is an extension of you. When wielding it, your attacks are _enhanced_. You are a trained, merciless fighter seeking glory and recognition. Once per day, you can issue a formal challenge to an adversary: if they accept, you both gain +1 Armor against each other's attacks and cannot be interrupted by others until the fight is over. Your reputation precedes you, and warriors recognize your skill (they may offer duels rather than combat to the death).
