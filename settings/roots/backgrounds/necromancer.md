# Background: Wizard
> You are a scholar of the arcane, or just naturally gifted. Either way, you handle spells and magic like no one else.

## Signature Move
**Grimoire** (_Bulky_ inventory item). This is the fruit of your research and your most precious belongings (only you can decipher it). You can spend four hours to copy a standard Spellbook into your **Grimoire** followed by a successful **WIL Save**. During this process the original Spellbook is destroyed. Scrolls cannot be copied.
## Attribute Modifiers
- -1 STR, +1 WIL
## Hit Protection Modifier
- 0

# Specialization: Necromancer
> You manipulate the forces of life and death and have a sick attraction for undead creatures. If recognized, you will be despised, banished or imprisoned in most settlements. You can speak with recently deceased corpses, they will talk to you like a friend. Get 1 **Fatigue** at the end of the conversation. You can cast **Leech Life**, inflicting **1d6 STR damage** to a target within 30ft (bypassing armor) by the same cost to your **WIL**.
